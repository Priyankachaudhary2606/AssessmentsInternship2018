<h4>An internship is a period of work experience offered by an organisation 
for a limited period of time.Once confined to medical graduates, the term is
 now used for a wide range of placements within businesses, non-profit organisations
 and government agencies. They are typically undertaken by students and graduates
 looking to gain relevant skills and experience in a particular field. Employers
 benefit from these placements because they often recruit employees from their best
 interns, who have known capabilities, thus saving time and money in the long run. 
Internships are usually arranged by third-party organisations which recruit interns on behalf
 of industry groups. Rules vary from country to country about when interns should be regarded
 as employees. The system can be open to exploitation by unscrupulous employers.</h4>
